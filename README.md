# Jackson_CSCI2270_FinalProject
"This is a test.Hello World" 
Joe Jackson Final Project: 
 For my final project I will be writting a program in C++ that will be able to convert any value that is read in from the command line into it's equivalent value in another numbering system. So far base ten and  binary will be the two numbering systems, but im thinking of also adding a scientific notation  or fractional setting . Will implement a user class that stores any calculations that a specified user make during a session. 

Requirements: 
There will be no special requirements for this project it will simply be a driver.cpp header.h and class.cpp
