# Jackson_CSCI2270_FinalProject
"This is a test.Hello World" 
Joe Jackson Final Project: 
In computer science we are regularly exposed to a number of differing numerical representations that at times can be hard to navigate. Wouldn't it be easy if there was a program that could convert between all of these numbering systems showing the user how a number in base ten is represented in say binary or hexidecimal. Well now there will be! For my final project I will be writting a program in C++ that will be able to convert any value that is read in from the command line into it's equivalent value in another numbering system. So far base ten, hexidecimal, and binary will be the three numbering systems, but im thinking of also adding a scientific notation setting or fractional.

Requirements: 
There will be no special requirements for this project it will simply be a driver.cpp header.h and class.cpp
